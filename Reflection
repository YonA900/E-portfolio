Reflective Summary: Younis Ali Saeed Khamis Alhussaini – SRM_PCOM7E July 2025 A e-Portfolio

Introduction
Throughout the Security and Risk Management (SRM_PCOM7E) module, I have undergone a significant journey of academic and practical development. This portfolio documents my engagement with the learning outcomes, team collaboration, risk assessment practices, and personal contribution to both group and individual assignments. I have deepened my understanding of cybersecurity risk frameworks, developed technical coding competencies, and enhanced my awareness of GDPR, disaster recovery, and organisational resilience through structured projects. This reflection will critically explore my learning journey by focusing on key components of the module: unit summaries, teamwork and meetings, reflective peer review, and individual implementation—culminating in coding outputs that translate theory into actionable insights.

Branch 1: units-summaries
The module’s structure through 12 learning units progressively built my expertise in managing cyber risks in digital ecosystems. From the start, Unit 1 introduced me to foundational risk concepts like confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) which set the tone for everything that followed. I particularly appreciated how Unit 2’s discussion on cyber threats contextualised theoretical knowledge with real-world relevance, such as phishing and insider threats in a hybrid work environment.
As I moved through Unit 3 on regulatory compliance, I engaged with frameworks like GDPR and ISO 27001, understanding how organisations implement safeguards and reporting mechanisms. These ideas were later applied directly in the Pampered Pets Risk Assessment report, where we had to assess how pet data (like names, health, and appointments) could be exposed or exploited.
Unit 4 and 5 deepened my understanding of risk assessment methodologies, introducing risk matrices and threat modelling. I learned how to score likelihood and impact—a skill I applied in our group work using DREAD and STRIDE frameworks. The unit on Disaster Recovery (Unit 6) was a turning point where I grasped the importance of continuity planning. These concepts were vital when designing the mitigation strategies for the Pampered Pets system.
From Unit 7 onwards, the focus shifted towards practical implementation and solution design. I especially enjoyed Unit 9’s discussion of security controls, which guided our coding efforts to implement robust, testable code. Overall, these units provided the necessary theoretical base that informed both my teamwork and independent work in the module.

Branch 2: meetings-and-groupwork
Collaboration was central to this module. My group consisted of three members: Younis, Sulaiman, and Abdullah. From the outset, we used WhatsApp and scheduled MS Teams meetings to discuss our approach to the group project. We decided early to focus on Pampered Pets, a fictional small business offering pet services with an online system. My primary role in the group was to handle the risk assessment structure, define asset categories, and help build the mitigation section.
One major achievement was coordinating the DREAD matrix, where we assigned risk values to vulnerabilities like weak access controls, data leakage through unauthenticated APIs, and phishing vectors. I contributed by outlining the likelihood criteria, helping standardise our scoring across the team.
Additionally, I was responsible for drafting the conclusion and recommendations, ensuring our project tied back to core principles like data minimisation and failover readiness. I also ensured our analysis complied with GDPR Article 32 and reflected current best practices in information security.
Challenges included coordinating across schedules and editing our risk report to fit the word limit. Despite these, our final group submission was cohesive, technically sound, and balanced in responsibilities. This collaborative experience mirrored real-world cyber project teamwork, where risk communication and documentation are just as important as identification.

Branch 3: reflection-and-peer-review
The peer review experience for the Risk Identification Report helped me understand the value of constructive feedback. I completed the Peer Evaluation Form with honesty and respect, scoring team members on criteria like participation, communication, and leadership.
I recognised that while I was technically strong, I needed to improve in time management, especially when coordinating feedback loops before submission deadlines. Through my peer review, I learned how important it is to appreciate others’ working styles and adapt collaboratively. This awareness was crucial for building emotional intelligence in future workplace leadership roles.
What stood out was the emphasis on trust and transparency in teamwork. I now understand how important psychological safety is in risk teams—people must feel safe to raise issues without fear. That learning is something I will carry into my future roles in cybersecurity teams or public service digital transformation.

Branch 4: individual-project-executive-summary
For the Individual Executive Summary, I selected the same Pampered Pets case and expanded the solution into a more technical roadmap. Here, I designed a disaster recovery strategy with a 1-minute failover requirement and encryption-based backup protocols.
The report began by reviewing key cyber threats, such as insider misuse and API vulnerabilities, before identifying 3 core risks: unauthorised access, insecure interfaces, and lack of data backups. I used a structured methodology combining the NIST framework and STRIDE model to analyse and prioritise each risk. I also proposed detailed controls like multi-factor authentication, encrypted database backups, and role-based access.
The most valuable part of this work was developing GDPR-aligned strategies. I discussed how Pampered Pets could apply data minimisation, ensure user consent transparency, and protect personally identifiable information. I also designed a disaster recovery timeline (prevention, detection, correction), a cloud backup policy, and incident response triggers.

Branch 5: coding-and-outputs
The coding element gave me a chance to bring abstract concepts into real implementation. Using Python, I simulated simple authentication checks, log analysis outputs, and encryption mechanisms based on what we had identified in the group report.
One example I created was a Python-based risk scoring function that takes inputs like threat likelihood and impact and returns a risk priority. Another was a mock log scanner that alerts when suspicious patterns like multiple failed logins appear. These small code snippets helped reinforce how cybersecurity is deeply tied to logic, automation, and scripts.

Conclusion
Completing the SRM_PCOM7E module has been one of the most transformative learning experiences in my postgraduate journey. I have developed practical and theoretical knowledge in cybersecurity risk management, collaborated effectively in diverse teams, and delivered individual solutions that align with professional standards. The structure of the module, through scaffolded units, practical assessments, and personal reflection, has prepared me to operate confidently in digital risk roles. I now see myself not only as a learner, but as a future leader in managing organisational resilience and security.

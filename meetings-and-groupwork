Author: Younis Ali Saeed Khamis Alhussaini

🗓️ 1. Group Formation and Planning

At the start of the module, our group—Younis Ali Saeed Khamis Alhussaini, Sulaiman, and Abdullah—was formed to complete the Pampered Pets risk identification project.
We met during Week 2 via Microsoft Teams to decide our workflow, choose communication channels, and allocate roles.

Younis: Risk identification lead and final editor.

Sulaiman: Technical threat modeller.

Abdullah: Compliance and policy researcher.

We created a shared Google Docs folder and WhatsApp group for rapid coordination.
Our first task was mapping assets—customer database, appointment system, and payment gateway—and aligning them with the STRIDE model.

💬 2. Weekly Coordination Meetings
🗓️ Week 3 – Initial Threat Mapping

Reviewed asset inventory and began drafting the DREAD matrix.

Agreed on a unified risk‑rating scale for consistency.

Younis volunteered to verify all citations and academic formatting.

🗓️ Week 5 – Risk Mitigation Frameworks

Compared ISO 27005 with NIST CSF.

Decided to integrate both for scalability and SME suitability.

Recorded all decisions in our shared meeting notes.

🗓️ Week 7 – Draft Consolidation

Reviewed each member’s section; merged risk tables and recommendations.

Younis refined the Conclusion and Recommendations sections to ensure narrative flow.

Feedback from peers suggested stronger links between identified threats and controls—this was implemented before submission.

🤝 3. Collaboration and Peer Evaluation

From the uploaded Peer Evaluation Template, all team members were rated highly for contribution and reliability.
Younis’s feedback summary:

Strengths: Strong analytical writing, consistent attendance, early submission of tasks.

Areas for growth: Could initiate more mid‑week progress updates.

To address this, Younis scheduled reminder messages before each weekly deadline, improving responsiveness and coordination in later units.
This process improved communication discipline—an essential cybersecurity team skill.

📚 4. Key Contributions by Younis Alhussaini

In the final Pampered Pets Risk Assessment Project, Younis:

Drafted Section 6 (Recommendations), focusing on phased implementation of MFA, encrypted backups, and employee awareness training.

Authored Section 7 (Conclusion), connecting risk findings to strategic resilience and regulatory compliance.

Verified alignment between identified STRIDE threats and DREAD scores.

Ensured academic referencing matched Harvard UoEO standards.

These inputs were acknowledged in peer comments for clarity and quality of writing.

🧾 5. Lessons Learned

The group project improved my ability to work under structured project management principles, handle shared editing environments, and balance technical and regulatory considerations.
I learned that successful risk assessment depends on clear communication, version control discipline, and shared accountability.
By working collaboratively, our group produced a report that mirrored professional cybersecurity team operations—integrating threat analysis, control selection, and compliance reasoning.
